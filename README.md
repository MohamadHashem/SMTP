The goal of this project is to create a simple mail client which sends an email to any email recipient. In other words, the client will need to establish a TCP connection with a mail server (e.g., Gmail), and dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol. The client sends an email from the insert email to another email address that the user selects while running the application, and then the TCP connection to the mail server is closed. This report is to demonstrate the issue that I faced when someone reads in the future to get help instead of looking for it or wasting time trying to solve it.
